# VI features

- **itc** : current span
- **ar** : area of the trajectory
- **lpa** : area with loop direction
- **md** : maximum distance
- **dpb** : distance between maximum and minimum point
- **angp** : angle between maximum and minimum points
- **len** : length of the trajectory

All these features are calculated over one cycle of the steady state signal, obtained in pick_cycle.py .
