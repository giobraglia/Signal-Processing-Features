# Area of the VI trajectories.
# This feature is computed using the Shoelace's formula, used to calculate the area of 
# polygons, implemented in the file shoelace.py .
# It's important to say that Shoelace's formula doesn't work for polygons with a self-intercepting shape.
# By the way, the approximation given by this formula turned out to be useful, even for self-intercepting
# signals.

# This feature come from : 
# A. L. Wang, B. X. Chen, C. G. Wang, and D. D. Hua, "Non-intrusive load monitoring algorithm based on features 
# of Vâ€“I trajectory" Electric Power Systems Research, 2018.
