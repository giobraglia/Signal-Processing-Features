# Signal-Processing-Features

All the presented codes are really simple algorithms that can helps in extracting features from signals, useful when talking about signal processing.

## The project

The features presented was calculated to build up a dataset that has been employed for classification purposes in NILM ( non-intrusive load monitoring ).
To extract and collecting data the used software was Python. In particular all the signals analyzed come from the COOLL dataset, therefore in the code snippets will be always used power, current or voltage signals (but actually codes can be implemented over any kind of signal).
