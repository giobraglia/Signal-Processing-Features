# Signal-Processing-Features

All the presented codes are really simple algorithms that can helps in extracting features from signals, useful when talking about signal processing.

## The project

The features presented was calculated to build up a dataset that has been employed for classification purposes in NILM ( non-intrusive load monitoring ).
To extract and collecting data the used software was Python. In particular, all the signals analyzed come from the COOLL dataset.
